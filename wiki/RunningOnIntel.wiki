#Instructions for running this on intel based macs

= Issues regarding MacIntel =

Under Leopard on MacIntel, Apple's ADB controller kernel extension, IOADBFamily.kext, is not installed.  This is a problem, as it contains the superclasses and user client classes for required by the iMate driver.  In order to build and / or run the iMate driver, it is necessary to build or install the Apple driver as well. 

= Details =

== Obtaining the source ==

The source for IOADBFamily can be downloaded from Apple's public source site.  The required file is http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/IOADBFamily/IOADBFamily-6.tar.gz

== Building the kernel extension ==

In order to build the extension, you will need Apple's developer tools installed on your machine.  These should have come with your copy of OSX, or can be downloaded at http://connect.apple.com (Apple Developer Connection membership required, the 'online' or, in other words, free, membership is sufficient)

Once you've fired up XCode, you'll notice that there is not an xcode project in the folder, only a .pbproj file suitable for Project Builder (XCode's predecessor) or XCode 2.x.  Fear not, in the Files section here, you'll find a .xcodeproj file suitable for XCode 2.x or 3.x.  Download this and place it in the root of the project, alongside the .pbproj , and open it with XCode.

Set the project  settings to "Release", and hit the build button.

Oh Noes!  Your build has failed!
