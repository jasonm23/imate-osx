= Running on Intel-based macs =

Under Leopard (at least) on intel-based machines, Apple's base ADB controller kernel extension, IOADBFamily.kext, is not installed.  This is a problem, as it contains the superclasses and user client classes for required by the iMate driver.  In order to build and / or run the iMate driver, it is necessary to build or install the Apple driver as well. 

A pre built universal binary version of this extension for OSX 10.4 and above is available from : http://code.google.com/p/imate-osx/downloads/list

== Details ==

=== Obtaining the source ===

The source for IOADBFamily can be downloaded from Apple's public source site.  The required file is http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/IOADBFamily/IOADBFamily-6.tar.gz

=== Building the kernel extension ===

In order to build the extension, you will need Apple's developer tools installed on your machine.  These should have come with your copy of OSX, or can be downloaded at http://connect.apple.com (Apple Developer Connection membership required, the 'online' or, in other words, free, membership is sufficient)

Once you've fired up XCode, you'll notice that there is not an xcode project in the folder, only a .pbproj file suitable for Project Builder (XCode's predecessor) or XCode 2.x.  Fear not, in the downloads section here, you'll find a .xcodeproj file suitable for XCode 2.x or 3.x.  Download this and place it in the root of the project, alongside the .pbproj.

Open a terminal window, change directory to the project root directory, and issue the following commands:

{{{
> xcodebuild -configuration Release DSTROOT=/ clean build 
> sudo xcodebuild -configuration Release DSTROOT=/ install
}}}
